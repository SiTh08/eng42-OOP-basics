### Definitions 

#### class ()
A class is an essential part of OOP. is a collection of methods. groups a bunch of methods. Classes are the cookie cutters/blue print for objects/instances of a class.

### (self) 
Self refers to the instance on which the method is being called. 

### Instance of a class
It is a specific example of class. It is not the class. Occurence of a specific class.

### Methods

Are functions that can be used by/on objects of a specific class. 

### Abstraction 
Is hidding complexity from the user and exposing only useful/ necessary parts to get something done. 

An example would be turning on a microwave using the start button. We don't need to know about the particle vibrations and resonance. We just need to know our food will be warm. 

### Inheritance 

The ability to inherit behaviours and characteristics from a parent class.
